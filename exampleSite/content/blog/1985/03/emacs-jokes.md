Richard M. Stallman (RMS, widely known for creating EMACS) is writing
a UNIX clone called GNU (which means Gnu's Not Unix--a recursive
acronym). 

This seems to open the way to a whole gnu class of jokes.  For
example:

<!--more-->

> Q:  What do you call a person who hacks while wearing no clothes?  
> A:  A gnudist.

> Q:  What do you call an eligible young hacker?  
> A:  Gnubile.

> Q:  What is a hacker's favorite candy?  
> A:  Gnugat.   (Though it contains little gnutrition.)

> Q:  What do you call a computer filled with air?  
> A:  Gnumatic.

> Q:  What do you call a novice hacker who keeps pestering you
>     with foolish questions?  
> A:  A gnuisance.

> Q:  What do you call a subtle, clever hack in the favorite language?  
> A:  A gnuanCe.

> Q:  What do you use a supercomputer for?  
> A:  Gnumerical analysis.

> Q:  What do you call a hacker who collects coins?  
> A:  A gnumismatist.

Well, there are more, just too gnumerous to tell all at once.  I think

EMACS may stand for "Editing MACroS," but some friends of mine
suggested some more creative definitions. Here they are. Anyone have
any additions?

When I log into my Xenix system with my 110 baud teletype, both vi
*and* Emacs are just too damn slow.  They print useless messages like,
'C-h for help' and '"foo" File is read only'.  So I use the editor
that doesn't waste my VALUABLE time.

ED(1)               UNIX Programmer's Manual                ED(1)

NAME
     ed - text editor

SYNOPSIS
     ed [ - ] [ -x ] [ name ]
DESCRIPTION
     Ed is the standard text editor.
```

Computer Scientists love ed, not just because it comes first
alphabetically, but because it's the standard.  Everyone else loves ed
because it's ED!

"Ed is the standard text editor."

And ed doesn't waste space on my Timex Sinclair.  Just look:

```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root          24 Oct 29  1929 /bin/ed
-rwxr-xr-t  4 root     1310720 Jan  1  1970 /usr/ucb/vi
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  5.89824e37 Oct 22  1990 /usr/bin/emacs
```

Of course, on the system *I* administrate, vi is symlinked to ed.
Emacs has been replaced by a shell script which

     1) Generates a syslog message at level LOG_EMERG;
     2) reduces the user's disk quota by 100K; and
     3) RUNS ED!!!!!!


"Ed is the standard text editor."

Let's look at a typical novice's session with the mighty ed:

```
golem> ed

?
help
?
?
?
quit
?
exit
?
bye
?
hello?
?
eat flaming death
?
^C
?
^C
?
^D
?
```

---
Note the consistent user interface and error reportage.  Ed is
generous enough to flag errors, yet prudent enough not to overwhelm
the novice with verbosity.

"Ed is the standard text editor."

Ed, the greatest WYGIWYG editor of all.

ED IS THE TRUE PATH TO NIRVANA!  ED HAS BEEN THE CHOICE OF EDUCATED
AND IGNORANT ALIKE FOR CENTURIES!  ED WILL NOT CORRUPT YOUR PRECIOUS
BODILY FLUIDS!!  ED IS THE STANDARD TEXT EDITOR!  ED MAKES THE SUN
SHINE AND THE BIRDS SING AND THE GRASS GREEN!!

When I use an editor, I don't want eight extra KILOBYTES of worthless
help screens and cursor positioning code!  I just want an EDitor!!
Not a "viitor".  Not a "emacsitor".  Those aren't even WORDS!!!! ED!
ED! ED IS THE STANDARD!!!
